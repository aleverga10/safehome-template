# safehome
A Java simulation of the well-known case study "SafeHome", invented by Dr. Roger Pressman in his book "Software Engineering: a Practitioner's Approach". 

This project composes of two applications: Sensors and Environment, the first of which is used to model (in a non-physical way) the inner workings of devices, in order to acknowledge the presence of undesired situations stated in the case study; the latter app is used to simulate a smart home and its rooms. 

SafeHome uses an openHAB local server to better represent a typical smart home control panel.  


This system represents my masters thesis' work at Politecnico di Milano university, Italy, developed in 2020 (A.Y 18/19), in which SafeHome was used to provide a controlled environment for occurrences of common uncertainty situations in real life (e.g. sensors failure, measurement error). Its behaviour was observed in response to those uncertainties.
